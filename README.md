> This is the [Red Devil Hackathon](https://reddevilhacks.github.io/) markdown submission template. Replace *italicized* placeholders with your project details and remove the markdown quotes as well.

> Here are some example submissions from Boosung's previous hackathons: [Frody](https://devpost.com/software/temptemp) and [Albatross](https://devpost.com/software/albatross).

# *Sample Project*
### *A 1-2 sentence description of the project.*
**Team:** *me myself and I*

**Submission video:** *Link to video.*
> ⏱️ The video should be 5 minutes or less. In the video, you should include the project inspiration, what it does, and a demo showcasing the key features.

> 🎥 The easiest way to make a video here would be to use OBS or Zoom for screen recording. You can upload the video as an unlisted video on YouTube and add the link here.

## What's next?
*What's next for the project? Are there any improvements, features, or long-term goals for this project? How might you go about doing so?*

## Try it out
*Include setup instructions so that judges (and others) can run your project locally. The judges must be able to run your application.*
